      "1 Number of pieces of feedback as this is the first negative meeting I've had from Weave. This may sound harsh, but I would not recommend Ananta for future paid concierge meetings for any members of the community for some time. I thought when I googled him that he was the founder of the Alike app, sold to Yahoo, but it turns out that he is using the same name as an app also in the same space, which seemed misleading. He is starting a consumer app around connecting people but did not have the most basic understanding of the consumer landscape or any of the companies in it after working on the project for 2+ years. Companies doing the exact same thing as him. The conversation was very one-sided in terms of him asking for who I knew that could be helpful. I provided candid feedback about his current stage and some suggestions of how to get to the next stage, but my recommendation would be to save other members of the community from meetings like this. In your defense, it really did look like a good connection and I appreciated meeting on my home turf. Thanks for giving that one a swing!\n",

Beyond that, I wasn't really sure what his purpose was taking meetings other than just getting coffee with other entrepreneurs. Maybe he saw no value in the meeting either, sounded like he might be looking for vc more than anything---not being one made me less interesting to him?? He also asked to change the meeting to later in the day...kind of a pain in the ass, but I was able to flip my schedule and make it anyhow. I think in the future, I will no longer accept a time change....this is the 3 time it's happened, FYI.\n",

Yes we were able to pick at each other's brain, but our experience matched a little too much and we couldn't offer strong advice. The biggest value out of this meeting was that we were able to share our various resources, but also tell each other our plans for future schooling and find that one of us has pursued that path and can provide advice.\n",

The most enjoyable piece of this conversation was getting a look at design perspective from another company, I really enjoyed hearing what challenges and triumphs AutoPilot/Christian was facing. Our start-ups are in different stages at this point, so sharing specific design tactics was hard. Still a wonderful and beneficial conversation, would love to chat again - I'm interested in how design at AutoPilot develops.\n",

FWIW, I don't expect every meeting to have value, but I'd hope that enough of these meetings would, as a whole, create at least a few meaningful connections that provide value later on.

Morgan, who I met, comes from the technology background and was originally from France. These two things that, I think, ultimately affects our topics - we ended up talking a lot about latest technology trends and how tech will affect people from different cultures. We both came with a very unselfish intent - just want to meet new people and talk about things, which made this meetup a very casual, relaxed experience. We talked for almost 50 mins before I had to leave for work. \n",

Troy's company is in the recruiting space, which is extremely interesting to me as a founder.  Unfortunately the timing is bad, if I had met him 4 months ago, I would have been very interested in using his service.  Now we have our own internal recruiter at Luxe, so it is just not the right timing for me to be able to leverage Troy.  But I believe he will be a valuable resource in the future.\n",

If that pans out, then yup I would say this is a 4. If it doesn't then the value of this meeting would actually go down. On the other side of the coin, I offered him help in the same way; where I can I'll make introductions based on his needs, but, I'm not sure I can fulfill them, so I could be just as un-valuable to him. That being said, it is always good to meet people and get people to talk about what you do, so meeting a lot of people is good and making the right impression is key.

I wanted to get feedback from investor's perspective on the idea and timeline, like when and how long they start investing into companies and I was able to get that info.
